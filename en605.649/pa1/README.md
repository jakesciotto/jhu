This application explores Naive Bayes and Winnow-2 algorithms
on five datasets from the UCI repository.

All helper functions for the driver class `iris.py` are located
in `bayes.py` or `winnow.py.` Report is under `docs` folder and
all datasets are included in `input` folder.

#### Directory Structure

	iris.py  
	bayes.py
	winnow.py  
	/docs  
		SciottoPA1.pdf
	/input 
	README.md

#### Input

The driver program, `main.py`, takes input from the `\input` folder.

#### Output

All generated output goes to the terminal.

#### Execution

`python main.py`
